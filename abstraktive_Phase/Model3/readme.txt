In this folder you find scirpts needed for training the third model.

Firstly, the Pointer_Generator_data_preprocessing.ipynb should be used on the text-abstract-pairs to transform the data into
the format that the model can process.

Then different combinations should be trained to gain the results. Here the four versions of combinations are all provided,
like in model2, they only differ from each other in path and some hyperparameters. If you want to try this with your own
data, remenber to change these accordingly.
