It might be difficult to have the overview of codes directly in GitHub. Therefore, the original links of the google colab for
the codes are also provided.

Basically, although different code file are given for different combination of text-abstracts pairs. However, they differ from 
each other only concerning the input data (path) and some hyperparameters (the longest encoding and decoding steps).
