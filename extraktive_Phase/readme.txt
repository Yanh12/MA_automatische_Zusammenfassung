with the TextRank-Algorithm.

The finshing_data.text provides the links for the six versions of the condensed texts, upon which you can easily get access to 
the final data of this phase and use them for further steps.

The "Questionnaire group1.pdf" and "questionnaire group2.pdf" were the complete questionnaires used in the thesis for evaluation the 
quality of the six condensed versions of texts. They're very long so they were not added to the appendix completely. 

The "answers group1.pdf" and "answers group2.pdf" were the answers from the participants from the two times of evaluation.
